he need Sizes to be classified into 4 groups in (ml)
  - <= 50 ml
  - 51 - 100 ml
  - 101 - 150 ml
  - +150 ml 

We find several cases in Sizes need to be converted to (ml)
  -- CASE 1 :
        sizes like (120ml+50ml) 170ml --- Take the number outside the parentheses without the unit .
        or (120g+50g) 170g without the unit (g) and convert it to (ml) by dividing by 1.4 
  -- CASE 2 :
        sizes like 100ml (125g) --- Take the number outside the parentheses
  -- CASE 3 :
        sizes like 100ml/125g --- Take the number in (ml)
  -- CASE 4 :
        sizes like 100g/77ml --- Take the number in (ml)
	-- CASE 5 : 
        sizes like 3.3oz (100ml) --- Take the number in (ml) inside the parentheses 
	-- CASE 6 : 
        sizes like 2.7oz (77g) --- Take the number in side the parentheses and convert it to (ml) by dividing by 1.4 
	-- CASE 7 : 
        sizes like 5.5oz(156) --- Take the number in side the parentheses and convert it to (ml) by dividing by 1.4 
	-- CASE 8 : 
        sizes in g Take the number in side the parentheses and convert it to (ml) by dividing by 1.4 
        sizes in ml Take only the number 
        sizes in lt Take only the number and add '000' at the end
